        <h2>Romeo and Juliet: Forcefulness of Love</h2>

            In Romeo and Juliet, love is what propels the story forward. In the famous play by Shakespeare, love
            controls most of the characters’ actions. In Romeo and Juliet’s case their love is carried out in a rash,
            passionate manner. Their love for eachother forces them to do a lot of things. The intensity of that emotion
            overpowers any other need which provides more dramatic and exciting elements to the play. Romeo and Juliet
            are willing to change their names and turn away from their families. Their love eventually forces Romeo to
            be exiled from Verona. Lastly, their love’s forcefulness is shown in the star-crossed lovers’ decisions of
            suicide.

            Love makes Romeo and Juliet declares that they will change their names to be with each other. “Deny thy
            father and refuse thy name,” Juliet asks, “or if thou wilt not, be but sworn my love, and I’ll no longer be
            a Capulet” (2.1.76-78) This is a very big step because family names and continuing the family was of big
            importance. Juliet and Romeo turning their backs on their families and marrying each other when their two
            families are in a violent feud, makes it even more rebellious and shocking. Love is also quite forceful in
            ways such as when Juliet was provided with a much safer, generally happier path of marrying Paris, a rich,
            handsome young man with good manners. Juliet’s passionate love for Romeo does not let her follow her
            family’s guidance which leads to schemes like pretending to be dead.

            Secondly, love forces Romeo to be exiled from Verona. This is typically because of how Romeo loved Juliet.
            Tybalt, a member of the Capulet House is blatantly furious and tries to murder Romeo. Romeo knows that
            Tybalt will be family after he marries Juliet, and decides he wants to be kinder. When he refuses to fight,
            Mercutio steps in Romeo’s place and agrees to fight to death. Romeo attempts to stop the fight trying to
            spare both of the lives of the enraged souls and Mercutio listens to Romeo. Then things spiral out of hand
            when Tybalt stabs Mercutio under Romeo’s arm totally ignoring the peace offer. In anger, Romeo murders
            Tybalt. This is an example of love pushing the events on forward in a ‘forceful’ manner with many skirmishes
            and unpredicted deaths.

            Finally, their love for eachother forces them into suicide and rash, passionate decisions. There are many
            points in the play when the characters could have ended up happier if they had simply thought more deeply.
            The characters, especially Romeo and Juliet, are blinded by intense love and make questionable decisions.
            One of these decisions, a quite fatal one, is their conclusion of suicide. Romeo could have waited a moment
            longer and be reunited with his supposedly ‘dead’ lover as she awakes from her deep sleep. He decides, or
            more so his love decides for him, that instant suicide is the only path to follow when his lover is found
            dead. This ultimately ends all hopes of Romeo and Juliet’s happy ending. Juliet wakes up from her sleep to
            see her other half dead beside her. Juliet’s love for Romeo cannot let her live on without him and she also
            decides to kill herself. Their love for each other forces the two star-crossed lovers to move through their
            lives very quickly and finally to their deaths.

            In conclusion, love is a major theme in the play Romeo and Juliet and is the biggest factor that forces the
            story to progress, to march the plot on. Juliet and Romeo are very different character-wise but they have
            one large thing in common, unconditional love for each other. This love leaves no choice to the couple but
            to make certain, sometimes foolish, decisions. Their love in other words is forceful. The forcefulness is
            essentially what makes the play so interesting and entertaining. Their passionate love shows the basics of
            what a young woman or man may think and act like when they are truly in love. In the modern world, lovers
            may feel as devastated like Romeo and Juliet and experience their own Romeo and Juliet story, but probably
            with less death than the famous tragic play.
