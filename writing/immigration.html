            Today was the day I was finally going to Canada. My mom and I had packed up all our belongings, which was
            not very much, and headed to the airport. Both of us had saved enough money by working to the extremes. My
            mom had four jobs, even working double shifts for one of them. I found three additional minor jobs to the
            two I already had. It took a tough year but this was all for being reunited with my dad who already went to
            Canada. It’s been five whole years since I last saw him and I was really excited to see him again.

            It was raining on the way to the airport. Pouring, in fact. Nonetheless, we arrived at the big, gray
            building, holding only one suitcase each. We quickly ran inside but my mom and I were both wet just from the
            few seconds of being exposed to the rain. We checked in, went through these strange metallic gates, talked
            to a scary-looking officer and did many other confusing things I didn’t understand the point of. Once we got
            through everything we needed to do, we walked through the vast place to Gate 64. My mom collapsed the moment
            we arrived into one of the chairs and gave out a big sigh. I, too, plopped down beside her near a big
            window. I looked out as the rain slapped at the glass violently and lost myself in the rain and in the gray
            sky. The minutes went by fast and it was soon time to board the plane. Tall women in uncomfortable looking
            uniforms checked our passport and our boarding pass once again and let us in. They smiled warmly but I
            noticed it didn’t quite reach their eyes. We found our seats once we were on the airplane and attempted to
            make ourselves comfortable. It didn’t work and I felt like I was being squeezed, compressed. I decided then,
            I did not like going on planes.

            A man’s rumbling voice came out of the speakers, introducing himself as the captain. I decided then, I did
            not like the captain. A little boy was crying and kicking at the back of my seat. An old man was grumbling
            and complaining beside me about the magazines in the front pockets of our seats. Some other immature
            teenager was playing a loud video game on his stupid phone. I decided then I did not like people. The musty
            air made me uncomfortable, and the rain did NOT help at all. “Why do people travel on planes?” I asked
            myself. I looked to my left and there was my beautiful mom. My poor, hard-working, inspiring mother. She was
            already dozing off. I tried to block out the invading sounds, ignore the slight bounces of my seat as the
            little child continued to kick my chair, and closed my eyes to sleep guided by the sound of rain. Angry,
            raging rain.
            I woke up as my whole body was shaking, my head nodding violently like I was just offered three scoops of
            double fudge ice cream. I gripped onto the thin, plastic armrests praying for my life. The captain’s voice
            told us to calm down and that it was just some turbulence. “Some turbulence?!” I shouted to my mom, but she
            couldn’t hear because the airplane was already filled with shouts and wails of other terrified passengers.
            It was certainly not just some turbulence. I squeezed my eyes shut, wishing for the whole thing to be over.
            I could only hear rain. Only rain, angry, furious rain. I didn’t want to be here.

            I just want this to stop.

            We landed safely in Canada. I was too shaken up to say anything. My mom looked pale and ten years older than
            an hour ago. We both agreed it was a nightmare. My dad came to greet us. We were crying, so happy to be safe
            in his arms. Thank god we were together again. We were whole.

            The sky shone bright from the beautiful warm rays of the sun and I was happy.
