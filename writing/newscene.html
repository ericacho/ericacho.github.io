        <h2>Torak Meets Wolf (New Scene)</h2>

            Some time before, a flash flood had come roaring down from the mountains. The waters had since subsided,
            leaving a mess of wet undergrowth and grass-strewn saplings. They’d also destroyed a wolf den on the other
            side of the gully. There, below a big red boulder, lay two drowned wolves like sodden fur cloaks. Three dead
            cubs floated in a puddle.

        <p>
            Their black, once piercing eyes, now seemed to have lost its way and was staring into somewhere far off into
            the great mountains.
            Torak went down to investigate, when he heard a soft, weak yip. He jumped and instantly pulled out his
            knife, his hands shaking. Torak crept closer to see what had made the sound. He saw a small, grey ball of
            fur shivering under a heavy branch. The small wolf cub seemed to have been in the way of the branch and when
            it fell, it had pinned the lower half of the cub onto the ground.
            The wolf looked terrifyingly thin and straggly and it seemed minorly injured. The wolf cub hadn’t noticed
            Torak yet. It kept looking at its dead family members all floating in the puddle beside it. It looked sad
            and confused. The cub kept whining and yipping, the best it could do to make a sound, to wake its brothers
            and sisters from their deep, deep sleep. Torak stood there watching the cub silently.
            As he shifted his weight, a branch cracked underneath Torak’s feet and the wolf cub spun its head around
            with surprising strength. The intensity of its sharp, pale blue eyes cut deep into Torak. The eyes. It
            looked like Torak’s.

        <p>
            Torak stumbled back. It was like looking into the river, himself reflecting right back into his eyes. The
            cub continued to stare at him for a while and finally gave up a long, hoarse howl. It rang in his mind,
            body, his soul.
            A vivid memory swallowed him whole. Black fur. Warmth. A wet, sniffling nose nudging at his face. A loving
            lick to wake him up. What does this mean? Where is this memory from? Torak could understand the dying cub’s
            pleading howl. “Please, help, please it’s hurting me.” How? How could Torak understand the howls and barks
            of this small wolf? This was impossible, he thought. But the wolf kept pleading, howling, begging for Torak
            to help him. “Brother, why are you just standing there? Why aren’t you helping me?” Again, Torak was
            startled that he could understand the sounds coming out of the wolf’s mouth. And what did the cub mean by
            “brother”? Torak shook all of his thoughts away. He felt he needed to free this cub but he knew the wolf
            could be food. The cub may be thin, but its belly fat could be crafted into an excellent meal. Torak was
            running out of food supplies….

            The wolf cub came in and out of consciousness. The smell of his brothers and sisters slowly fading away,
            carried away by the water. A new smell had dominated over it, a strange smell of dead prey. The wolf cub
            felt sharp pains all over his legs and couldn’t move anything. He was scared. So, so scared. It had been
            three moons now since the cold hand had swallowed his home. He called for his mother. “Where is she? Why
            isn’t she protecting me?” He barked, yipped and howled for anyone to come and free him. He felt tired.
            Hungry. Weak.
            The cub’s eyes opened again, his mother still hadn’t come and his legs were still sending streaks of pain
            through his body but in a more numb way. The cub could not make a sound. Only small yips could slip through
            his tongue, his last and desperate call for help. Then a “SNAP”! He swung his head around, is it his mother?
            Father? Instead of a wolf, there stood a tall, standing creature. He had almost no fur, only some on the top
            of his head. Where was his tail? Where were his claws? This thing was not a wolf. Then the wolf saw the
            eyes. And felt the creature’s soul. Strange mixes of wolf were embedded into his mind. His eyes were for
            sure one of wolf cub’s kind. This creature MUST be a wolf, the wolf cub could sense it. “Brother! Brother!
            Please help!” He stopped, hesitated and thought for a very, very long time. Why wasn’t he helping me? The
            wolf cub was getting extremely frustrated. Finally, the tall, tailless wolf stomped down from where he was
            standing. He grabbed onto the branch and grunted, lifting the branch off with quite difficulty.
