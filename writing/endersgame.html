                    The book “Ender’s Game” is about a six-year old boy named Ender who is sent to Battle School to train and
                    become a commander. He is surrounded by soldier-like children and teachers who may be considered strange in
                    the 21st century. The the teachers at Battle School do not like to interfere with anything that is happening
                    at the school, even if it is violent or sometimes even life-threatening. Teachers are supposed to be to be
                    the protector, be warm, enthusiastic, and help children get along with each other. The teachers of Battle
                    School are different and here is how.

                    Teachers are supposed to be protective, and keep their students from getting hurt. Teachers should act as
                    parent-like figures to teach their pupils the right, honourable way of doing things. In Ender’s Game, the
                    teachers at Battle School are nothing close to being parents and even farther away from being honourable.
                    “For a moment, the others backed away and Stilson lay motionless. They were all wondering if he was dead.”
                    “So Ender walked to Stilson’s supine body and kicked him again, viciously, in the ribs. Ender walked around
                    him and kicked him again, in the crotch. He kicked Stilson in the face. Blood from his nose spattered the
                    ground nearby.” (pg.7) Later, the readers find out Stilson dies because of Ender. Ender has another brutal
                    fight with Bonzo Madrid, one of Ender’s commanders when Ender is a soldier and part of an army. “Bonzo did
                    not cry out in pain. He did not react at all, except that his body rose a little in the air. It was as if
                    Ender had kicked a piece of furniture. Bonzo collapsed, fell to the side and sprawled directly under the
                    spray of steaming water from a shower. He made no movement whatever to escape the murderous heat.” (pg.211)
                    These two fights have two major things in common; Ender’s opponent both dies and that the teachers are
                    actually watching the murderous fights unfold and doing nothing. Teachers should not be simply watching the
                    kids fight each other to death and should act out to stop the fights.

                    Next, a good teacher should help children get along, help them resolve their problems in a healthy,
                    agreeable way. They should help students make friends and create fun, enjoyable relationships with each
                    other. At Battle School, this is not the case. Colonel Graff and his second-in-command, Major Anderson talks
                    about how isolating Ender from his fellow “launchies” is the best to build him into a commander. They
                    purposefully want to isolate Ender from his peers by creating a wall between them. “Pinheaded little morons.
                    There’s only one boy on this launch with any brains at all, and that’s Ender Wiggin. He’s going to be a
                    commander when your still in diapers up there.” (pg.31) Graff isolates Ender from the very start by
                    comparing Ender and the others. Graff and Anderson do not truly care for Ender and wants to build and chisel
                    him into the perfect commander who will lead them to victory once and for all.

                    Finally, teachers should also try to create a welcoming and comfortable environment for the students, with
                    just enough challenges to keep them on their toes. This way, a student can push themselves to improve and
                    grow but continue being happy and ambitious. At Battle School, the teachers think they do not have the time
                    to let Ender breathe and bombards him with a myriad of problems he needs to solve. They need to build Ender
                    into the commander they want and they need to do it fast. So, they promote Ender faster than any other
                    soldier has ever been at record-breaking, young ages. Ender is suddenly the commander of an army made of
                    only inexperienced, weak ‘launchies’ with not a single skilled soldier. They instruct him to make the army
                    the best they have ever seen. They assign Ender’s army to their first battle after only three weeks of
                    training. When Ender and his army persevere, the teachers force them to compete in battle games everyday.
                    The fact that armies are supposed to have their first game after three months of training and that armies
                    are only supposed to have battle games once two weeks, makes the situation for Ender even more ridiculous.
                    When Ender’s army perseveres, they even go to the extent of forcing them to play two games a day, everyday
                    of the week. This almost breaks Ender down.

                    In conclusion, the teachers of Battle school are very different from what society thinks a teacher should be
                    like. They do not think of the children as children and students as students but soldiers that they can toy
                    around with. Their actions root from more political reasons than sympathetic ones and this is a big problem
                    in the novel. Ender’s teachers do not protect their pupils. They isolate them from others to build them as
                    soldiers, and create an almost impossible environment for their students to thrive in. Good teachers should
                    be there to support their students and help guide themselves to a bright and happy future. Teachers affect
                    children in quite big ways and they are very important in a child’s life.
