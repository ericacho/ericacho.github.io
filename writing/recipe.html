            <li>Heat oven to 350F</li>
            <li>In a medium bowl, whisk together the flour, lemon zest, baking powder, and salt, set aside</li>

            <li>Beat in the eggs, one at a time, then the vanilla, scraping down the sides of the bowl as necessary.
            </li>
            <li>Reduce mixer speed to low. Add the flour mixture in 3 additions and the milk in 2 additions, beginning
                and ending with the flour mixture. Mix just until combined (do not overmix).</li>
            <li>Divide the batter evenly among the muffin cups. Bake until a toothpick inserted in the center comes out
